# Optionally, specify how to launch the source code of your actor.
# By default, Apify's base Docker images define the CMD instruction
# that runs the Node.js source code using the command specified
# in the "scripts.start" section of the package.json file.
# In short, the instruction looks something like this:
#
# CMD npm start
